given at WUSS 2019 in Seattle.


## Important Note

2019-09-09 (Monday, Sepember 9)

I need to make two changes to the documentation:

- It is not necessary to turn ODS output on and off in order to see both the log and the ODS output.  Instead, you can use the "magic"
```%showLog``` as the first line in a code cell.  There are still occasions when you might want to use the macros I provided, but in the case of a normal run with no errors, it is easier to use the %magic instead.

- There are simpler ways to install the Jupyter system and extensions in Anaconda.  I will re-write that appendix.

I hope to have this done by the end of this week.
