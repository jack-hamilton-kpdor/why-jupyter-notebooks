SAS Presentation "I Don't Use Python or R - Why Should I Use Jupyter Notebooks?" and associated materials

This repository contains materials related to my presentation 
_I Don't Use Python or R - Why Should I Use Jupyter Notebooks?_ 
given at WUSS 2019 in Seattle.

The original paper from the proceedings is ``89-2019-Jupyter-Notebooks.pdf``.  The most recent updated version is in ``JupyterPaper.pdf`` 

The major changes since Seattle:

- Mention code completion, which is activated by pressing the TAB key.
- Mention the ``%showLog`` magic.
- Describe the situation with extensions, which at the time of this writing are mostly broken.
